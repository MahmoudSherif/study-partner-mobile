## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Users should feel accomplished, motivated, and in control of their learning journey

**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, encouraging - balancing productivity focus with gentle motivation

**Visual Metaphors**: Progress bars, growth charts, achievement badges - elements that represent advancement and success

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that highlights content and data while maintaining visual interest

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with strategic accent colors

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 200)) - representing focus, trust, and academic pursuit
**Secondary Colors**: Light gray-blue (oklch(0.85 0.02 220)) - supporting backgrounds and secondary actions
**Accent Color**: Warm orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 50)) - highlighting achievements, progress, and positive actions
**Color Psychology**: Blue promotes focus and calm study environments, orange provides energizing motivation
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Background (light blue-white) with dark text for maximum readability
- Primary buttons use blue background with white text
- Accent elements use orange with white text for strong contrast

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers (600-700 weight), body text (400), and secondary text (muted)
**Font Personality**: Modern, readable, approachable - suitable for extended study app usage
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing scale and spacing throughout interface
**Which fonts**: Inter - excellent for mobile interfaces with strong legibility
**Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent readability at small sizes crucial for mobile usage

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Tab-based navigation guides users through main functions, with data visualization as focal points
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between elements to reduce cognitive load during study breaks
**Grid System**: Mobile-first responsive grid with consistent padding and component spacing
**Content Density**: Balanced information display that provides insights without overwhelming users

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions that reinforce user actions and provide feedback
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Progress indicators and achievement unlocks receive animation focus
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Gentle, productivity-focused animations that don't distract from studying

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for grouping related information
- Tabs for main navigation
- Dialogs for session completion and important notifications
- Charts (Recharts) for data visualization
- Select dropdowns for subject selection in analytics

**Component Customization**: Rounded corners (0.75rem radius) and custom color applications for subject-specific elements
**Component States**: Clear hover and active states for interactive elements
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency - Clock, BookOpen, ChartBar, Trophy
**Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly sizing with minimum 44px touch targets

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance maintained throughout interface with careful attention to chart readability

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Potential Obstacles**: 
- Users forgetting to stop timers
- Incomplete subject setup affecting analytics
- Data loss during app updates

**Edge Case Handling**: 
- Session cancellation with confirmation
- Empty state guidance for new users
- Graceful handling of missing data in charts

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Chart performance with large amounts of historical data
**Testing Focus**: Data persistence accuracy and chart rendering on various screen sizes
**Critical Questions**: How much historical data should be maintained for optimal performance?

## Key Updates - Subject-Specific Progress Charts

The recent enhancement adds comprehensive subject-specific analytics including:

1. **Individual Subject Selection**: Dropdown to choose specific subjects for detailed analysis
2. **Subject Weekly Progress**: Area charts showing study time trends for selected subjects
3. **Subject Monthly Trends**: Long-term progress visualization for individual topics
4. **Subject Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of this week vs last week performance across all subjects
5. **Performance Insights**: Detailed metrics including total time, weekly averages, and goal progress with visual progress bars

These features transform the app from general study tracking to sophisticated per-subject performance analysis, enabling students to identify which topics need more attention and track improvement over time.

## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines simplicity with powerful analytics, providing immediate value (timer) while building long-term engagement through insights and achievements. The subject-specific charts add significant value by enabling targeted study strategy optimization.

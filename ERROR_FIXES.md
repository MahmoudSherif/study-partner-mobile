# Error Fixes Applied

## Issue: "process is not defined" Error

### Root Cause
The application was trying to access `process.env` environment variables in a browser environment, which is not available. This is because the codebase was originally configured for Create React App but is now using Vite.

### Fixes Applied

1. **Updated API Configuration (`src/lib/api.ts`)**
   - Changed `process.env.REACT_APP_STUDYPARTNER_API_URL` to `import.meta.env.VITE_STUDYPARTNER_API_URL`
   - Changed `process.env.REACT_APP_STUDYPARTNER_API_KEY` to `import.meta.env.VITE_STUDYPARTNER_API_KEY`

2. **Updated Error Boundary (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)**
   - Changed `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` to `import.meta.env.DEV`

3. **Updated Environment Variables (`.env.example`)**
   - Changed all `REACT_APP_` prefixes to `VITE_` prefixes to match Vite's environment variable convention

4. **Added Type Definitions (`src/vite-env.d.ts`)**
   - Created proper TypeScript definitions for all Vite environment variables
   - Includes StudyPartner API configuration variables
   - Includes Firebase configuration variables

### Environment Variables Now Supported
- `VITE_STUDYPARTNER_API_URL` - StudyPartner API base URL
- `VITE_STUDYPARTNER_API_KEY` - StudyPartner API key
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `VITE_FIREBASE_*` - Firebase configuration variables
- And more for feature flags and debugging

### Result
The "process is not defined" error should now be resolved, and the application should build and run properly in the browser environment using Vite's environment variable system.

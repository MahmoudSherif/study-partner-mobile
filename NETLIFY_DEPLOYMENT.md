# ðŸš€ Netlify Deployment Guide

This repository is now configured for easy deployment on Netlify with Firebase integration.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- A Netlify account
- A GitHub repository with this code
- Firebase project (optional - fallback values are included)

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Steps

### 1. **Connect to Netlify**

1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select this repository: `MahmoudSherif/study-partner-mobile`

### 2. **Configure Build Settings**

Netlify will automatically detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Node.js version**: 18

### 3. **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**

For enhanced security, you can override the Firebase configuration:

1. Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add the following variables:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

**Note**: If you don't set these, the app will use the fallback Firebase configuration that's already included.

### 4. **Deploy**

1. Click "Deploy Site"
2. Wait for the build to complete
3. Your app will be available at `https://[site-name].netlify.app`

## ðŸ”¥ Firebase Configuration

This repository includes Firebase configuration with fallback values, so the app will work immediately after deployment. The Firebase project includes:

- **Authentication**: Email/password and Google sign-in
- **Firestore Database**: User data storage
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking (optional)

### Security Note

While fallback values are included for immediate deployment, it's recommended to:
1. Create your own Firebase project
2. Set the environment variables in Netlify
3. Configure your own Firestore security rules

## âœ… What's Included

- âœ… Firebase authentication and database
- âœ… Automatic SPA routing with redirects
- âœ… Security headers
- âœ… Build optimization
- âœ… Environment variable support
- âœ… Analytics integration

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure Node.js version is set to 18
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json

### App Doesn't Load
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the site URL is correct
- Check if redirects are working (should redirect to index.html)

- Verify Firebase configuration
- Check Firebase project settings
- Ensure Firestore rules allow authentication

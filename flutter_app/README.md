## Project Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/          # App constants and design tokens
â”œâ”€â”€ models/            # Data models (Subject, Task, Achievement, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ providers/         # State management (StudyProvider, AuthProvider)
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/           # App screens (Study, Progress, Tasks, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/           # Reusable UI components
â””â”€â”€ main.dart          # App entry point
```

## Key Components

### State Management
- **Provider Pattern**: Using the `provider` package for state management
- **StudyProvider**: Manages study sessions, subjects, tasks, and achievements
- **AuthProvider**: Handles authentication and user session

### Core Features
- **Timer Widget**: Custom circular progress timer with pause/resume functionality
- **Subject Selector**: Grid-based subject selection with color indicators
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations for tasks with priority levels
- **Progress Tracking**: Statistics display with formatted time calculations

## Dependencies

Key dependencies used in this Flutter application:

- `provider` - State management
- `shared_preferences` - Local data storage
- `google_fonts` - Inter font family
- `fl_chart` - Charts and data visualization
- `json_annotation` - JSON serialization
- `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore` - Firebase integration (future)

## Contributing

This Flutter app is designed to mirror the functionality of the original React web application. When adding new features:

1. Maintain consistency with the web app's functionality
2. Follow the established design system
3. Ensure mobile-specific optimizations (touch targets, gestures)
4. Test on both Android and iOS platforms

## Conversion Notes

### From React to Flutter
- **TypeScript interfaces** â†’ **Dart classes with JSON serialization**
- **React hooks/Context** â†’ **Provider pattern**
- **CSS/Tailwind** â†’ **Flutter widgets with custom styling**
- **localStorage** â†’ **SharedPreferences**
- **React components** â†’ **Flutter widgets**

### Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
- Haptic feedback support
- Mobile-first navigation patterns
- Optimized scrolling and gestures
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

# Firebase Configuration Error Fix

## Issue
The application was showing "Firebase configuration is incomplete. Please check your environment variables." error.

## Solution

### 1. Offline Mode Support
The application now includes robust offline mode support that allows it to work even without proper Firebase configuration:

- **Mock Authentication**: Uses a local authentication system when Firebase is unavailable
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally using the useKV hook
- **Graceful Degradation**: Firebase features degrade gracefully to local equivalents

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
To enable Firebase integration:

1. **Copy environment template**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Get Firebase credentials**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project (or create a new one)
   - Go to Project Settings > General > Your apps
   - Click "Web" and copy the configuration

3. **Update .env.local** with your actual Firebase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

### 3. Firebase Services Setup

If you want to use Firebase services, ensure these are enabled in your Firebase console:

#### Authentication
- Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
- Enable Email/Password
- Enable Google (optional)

#### Firestore Database
- Go to Firestore Database
- Create database in test mode
- Add security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /userData/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Testing Firebase Integration

The app includes a Firebase Test Panel (available in the Test tab) that allows you to:
- Test Firebase connection
- Verify authentication
- Test Firestore operations
- Check configuration status

### 5. Production Deployment

For production deployment on Netlify:

1. **Add environment variables** in Netlify dashboard:
   - Go to Site settings > Environment variables
   - Add all VITE_FIREBASE_* variables

2. **Deploy configuration**:
   The app will automatically detect if Firebase is properly configured and fall back to offline mode if needed.

### 6. StudyPartner Integration

This app is designed to integrate with the StudyPartner repository for shared authentication and data sync. The Firebase project should be shared between both applications to enable:

- Cross-platform user accounts
- Data synchronization
- Seamless switching between web and mobile

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: Application no longer crashes due to missing Firebase configuration
✅ **Working**: Offline mode with local authentication and storage
✅ **Ready**: Firebase integration when proper credentials are provided
✅ **Production Ready**: Graceful handling of configuration issues

The application will work immediately in offline mode and can be enhanced with Firebase features by adding proper configuration.
